js:

var:

Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function where they are declared.
var variables are hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.

let:

Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (e.g., a function, loop, or conditional statement) where they are declared.
let variables are not hoisted in the same way as var variables.

const:

Variables declared with const are block-scoped like let, but they cannot be reassigned after initialization.
const is typically used for values that should not be changed.
